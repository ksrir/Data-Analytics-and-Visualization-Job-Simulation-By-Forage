# Data-Analytics-and-Visualization-Job-Simulation-By-Forage
In this project, I worked with Social Buzz, a rapidly growing social media and content creation platform, to analyze their vast dataset. The simulation involved working with several data tables, including user profiles, sessions, content, and reactions, which provided insights into user behavior and content popularity.

I began by collecting and cleaning the data using Excel to ensure accuracy and consistency. This involved standardizing fields, removing duplicates, handling missing values, and merging relevant datasets such as user profiles, session data, and content reactions. Once the data was transformed, I calculated key metrics to assess content engagement, user session duration, and reaction trends.

To meet the clientâ€™s expectations, I created visualizations in Excel that highlighted the top-performing content categories, reaction types, and user engagement metrics. These visuals provided Social Buzz with actionable insights into their data landscape and prepared them for their upcoming IPO by showcasing the most popular content trends.
